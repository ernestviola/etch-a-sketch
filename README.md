An etch a sketch inspired webpage. Drag your mouse over the nodes to change it's
color.


Psuedocode

Create a container that contains all of the nodes up to 16

Distribute equally each of the nodes height and width wise using some calculation
- If 16 I want to go 4 x 4. So many we can do some sort of square root?
- If 25 it should by 5 x 5? But we have more space width wise than height wise.


Color the background of the node when we hover over it
- Use a random color to update the background
- When hover a background that has a color darken that color
- Over time the color should lighten to white

Implement a slider that can increase the number of nodes
- Add event onSliderChange that updates the number of nodes
